    <h2>Techniques</h2>

    <h3>SEO Techniques</h3>
        <p>Mobile Optimization is very useful as this technique ensures the website is fully functional and visually appealing on mobile devices. This can be 
        implemented as a responsive design using CSS. In today's culture, more users tend to access websites via smartphones or tablets, which 
        increases the demand for responsive design in order to retain visitors and improve search engine rankings. Due to its diverse functionality, 
        it improves rankings in terms of searches, as most browsers, including Google, prioritize mobile-friendly websites. (Moz, 2024)</p>

        <p>Heading Tags are one of the most valuable techniques as they structure a website's content entirely. These tags create an organized hierarchy with information in a logical order 
         , which helps users navigate the website's content. For example, "h1" is reserved for the main heading, which signifies the primary topic of the web page.
        The following elements "h2" and "h3" organize the web page into sub headings and sub sections, enhancing the website's SEO and readibility for the website's users.
        In addition, including keywords in heading tags help increase relevancy in search engines. Search engines tend to favour well-structured content on websites due to 
        its alignment with accessibility and usability principles. (Google Search Central, 2024) </p>

        <p>Meta Descriptions are interesting due to their dual purpose. It serves as a teaser for users and guides search engines by providing a brief but informative
        summary of the webpage. This sets the tone for what users can expect when viewing the website, setting expectations. These descriptions play a significant role in attracting users to
        click on the website based on the descriptions displayed in the search engine result pages. Meta descriptions include keywords that are relevant to the user's query and 
        significantly increase the click-through rates. Thus, meta descriptions can differentiate a website from competitors in search engines with captivating words, drawing
        more attention to the website.(SEOExperts, 2023)</p>

    <h3>SMO Techniques</h3>

        <i class="fab fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i> 
    </a>

        <p> Social Sharing buttons are a powerful technique that bridges the gap between a website and social media platforms. These buttons amplify a website's visibility and reach 
        as they allow users to share content directly on platforms such as Instagram, X, Facebook, and LinkedIn. It is a great tactic to build brand awareness and foster community connection
        , as these sharing buttons can be easily distributed by website users to their networks. This can result in an increase in engagement and traffic. The usage of social media continues to grow
        and showcases a competitive side of promotion; thus, integrating sharing buttons has become essential for websites to maintain a competitive component. (Bhargava, 2024)</p>

        <p> User-generated content is an engaging technique as it encourages users to contribute content related to the website. Examples of this content can be website reviews, testimonials, or
            posts featuring a hashtag related to the website. This builds trust amongst website visitors and increases authenticity and credibility. User-generated content creates a 
            dynamic environment for businesses as the content resonates with the audience, fostering a sense of community. Hence, utilizing this content contributes to a higher 
            visibility on social media as users actively share their contributions, leading to traffic.
           (Lockard, 2024) </p>

        <p>Embedding Social Media profiles is an innovative technique that enhances user engagement while keeping users on the website. It allows users to view recent posts
            or updates on their social media profiles without needing to leave the website. Additionally, embedding social media profiles on your website, such as X or LinkedIn, demonstrates 
            transparency and activity, which makes the website more appealing to visitors. It encourages users to follow these social media profiles, strengthening the brand's online presence.
            Hence, its simplicity is an effective way to merge website content with social media activity which creates a cohesive user experience. (HubSpot, 2024)</p>
